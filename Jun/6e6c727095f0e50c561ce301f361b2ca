&nbsp; It s festive term again police evacuate tramps from beaches, parks and passageways for the ease and security of tourists &amp; revellers my friend Theliweni says it s a lofty project these folks bring money to the city we hobos shall benefit a lot from the trickle-down effect for now we must hustle thirty bucks a day for a night at the shelter or just find some tunnel at the fringes. i migrate back to the township via metrorail a surprise visit to next-of-kin who don t even know my name i arrive in the early hours announcing that i m on holiday broadcasting to all &amp; sundry i Ntwana the Kid came on first class British Airways i also declare that i m in the tourism industry backing the claim with photographs of me standing with celebrities &amp; nobilities outside upmarket hotels &amp; restaurants &amp; selfies of me chilling in a villa by the beach * Chana vows on his life &amp; the Holy Ghost that the eccentric artist who lives next door was sent to a mental asylum after being caught doing things to a dog but his mother swears with every pint of blood in her body some sadist gangster put a gun on the poor boy s head to force him into the dog while a knife fucked his arse a bizarre orgy adapted from a grotesque sculpture the surrealist artist erected at the park nearby his home * Since i have so many tales to tell from all major cities of the world i receive enough friends and freebies to join the chorus: ke december, boss! in the meantime everyone is eager to give me updates on the township scene it s too arduous an activity for my ears &amp; brain to isolate fiction from actual facts or sift the factual from the fabricated I know Mzala enough to dismiss his claim that he was a personal advisor to a chief executive officer who was relieved of his duties for using a company credit card to buy one night of forbidden pleasure that the new chief came with her own team therefore dismissing the old crew My reliable sources tell me just as it s the case with me there never was a time when Mzala was off the streets the little bit i am able to get from press clippings &amp; Google confirms that the CEO Mzala mentioned was relieved of his position at such a firm for irregular use of the company credit card but provides no details of where and how for what * Fast-forward into the future is my sad story a bullet in my skull panga chopping me into pieces my flesh thrown into the sty to feed pigs because of the stories i tell even after explaining so well that my stories are 100% fiction plus 100% facts &amp; the personas are honest fictional characters telling stories of real people like Girly the poor girl in a wheelchair always wearing a sad face after the visit of a male social worker with a perverted sense of personal provision of social services There is no one to listen to the girl s cry ever since her mother died from heart-attack after her son Boy-Boy received a life sentence for murdering his uncle Scarface for the horrid and sordid things that uncle Scarface did to Girly and Boy-Boy their father lives in the bottle one aunt is reported to be a nurse or something somewhere in Kuwait the rest of the family is missing in action many will appear when either she or her brother or father dies to demand identity documents for their insurance claims they are too busy preparing for the dead &amp; the hereafter to waste their time and worries on the living &nbsp; This poem appears in the June 2016 issue of New Coin, the South African poetry journal published by the Institute for the Study of English in Africa (ISEA).
